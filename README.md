# student-project

How to run: 

Front-end:

Run the front-end by navigating to the project's front-end (student-front-end) using a terminal and running "npm start".

By default the project starts on port localhost:3000. Use this URL in the browser to access the front-end of the application.

Back-end:

Run the back-end by opening up student-back-end (located within student-project) in an IDE and running the the main application file (StudentProjectApplication).

By default the back-end starts on port localhost:8080.


How to use the application:

Initially you will be loaded onto the home screen where by default there are no students listed. 

To add a student click the add student link in the navigation bar and that will lead you to a form to create a new student. Once the information is provided hit the "Add Student" button and the student will be added. To see the student click the "Home" link in the navigation bar and it will be displayed on the screen.

To modify a student's information, when you are on the home screen simply click the "modify student info" button on a student's card, change the desired information, and then hit save. If you navigate back to the home screen the new information will now be reflected on the student's card.

To delete a student from the record, simply hit the "delete" button on a student's card.

To search for a student simply click the "Search Student" route on the navigation bar at the top and enter a valid student's ID (this can be seen on the home screen where the ID for each student is listed on their card) and then click search. The student's card will then appear.

For student's on the main screen you can filter them by school type by using the dropdown and selecting one of the relevant options (No Filter, High School, College).
